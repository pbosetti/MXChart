MXChartView
===========

MXChartView is a UIView designeable subclass written in Swift for quickly and easily create line charts.

The class currently supports multiple data series and can be easily customized.

It will be improved in time, but It is aimed at remaining easy and simple to use, in order to fit those needing to quickly chart data without having to deal with a carrier-class mothership like the venerable [CorePlot](https://github.com/core-plot).

The XCode project targets iOS 8 and comes as an example universal app that collects and shows in realtime the three acceleration components, updated at 60 Hz rate. The MXChartView class itself is in one single file, `MXChartView.swift`.
